<p><span class="red lead">The global population is expected to reach </span><span class="lead red"><a href="https://population.un.org/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2017_KeyFindings.pdf">9.8 billion by 2050</a></span><span class="red lead">. </span>Experts estimate agricultural productivity must increase 70% from current levels to feed the planet. As global prosperity increases, so does the demand for crops and livestock. Further, 90% of the food supply will have to come from land already in production because land expansion will not fulfill crop production needs.</p>
<p>During the last several years, record-breaking harvests have removed more and more phosphorus and potassium from farm fields across the globe. Because crop nutrients are not self-sustaining, when crop production steps up, so does the need to replace harvested nutrients. Sustainably growing more food depends on fertilizers, which are responsible for producing up to 60% of all crop yields. With nutrient-deficient land throughout growing regions, crop nutrients are fundamental to producing enough nutritious food, fiber and fuel to sustain world needs. This is where Mosaic comes in.</p>

<p><span class="red lead">At Mosaic we promote, partner, invest and engage in nutrient stewardship efforts across North America.</span> For the sake of both the environment and the future of agriculture, one challenge to overcome is nutrient runoff. When nutrients run off farmland into a waterway, they can contribute to impaired water quality and can also nourish algal blooms. Other sources of nutrients that can run off into local waterways include livestock manure, urban storm water, municipal wastewater discharge and lawn fertilizer. It is in everyone’s best interest that nutrients are used efficiently.</p>
<p>The concept of nutrient stewardship is simple, but implementation is knowledge-intensive and varies farm by farm. We seek partnerships with organizations that have the local relationships and knowledge necessary to advance nutrient stewardship in a way that maximizes positive impact. Our vision? Clean water for every generation.</p>
<p>The map below highlights three of Mosaic’s many nutrient stewardship partners in North America.</p>

<p>Mosaic’s support of <span style="color: #afd05b;"><a class="green" style="color: #afd05b;" href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/">The Nature Conservancy (TNC)</a> </span>has helped advance 4R Nutrient Stewardship practices and increase crop yields, all while reducing agriculture’s environmental impact. Mosaic and TNC are working together to achieve increased implementation of farming best management practices, reduced nutrient loss and improved water quality for all Floridians. Through this collaboration and with The Mosaic Company Foundation’s more than $3.1 million investment, over 4,500 farmers, growers and ranchers have received the 4R message—representing more than 350,000 acres.</p>
<p>In addition to this project, Mosaic also partners with TNC to fund the North American Ag Program. Through this program, TNC has established a platform of global priorities, which includes support for the development of sustainable agriculture to meet global demands for food, while safeguarding the lands and waters vital to people and nature. A section of this project supports the larger TNC goal to manage the soil health of half of all the U.S. row crop acres by 2025.</p>

<p><span class="red lead">With the world&#8217;s ever-growing population, helping farmers to be more productive is crucial.</span> Smallholder farmers—those with fewer than 25 acres—work 90% of the world’s farms, but many of these growers are food insecure and struggling to earn a living and feed their own families. In India, this issue is even more critical since average yields are 50 to 70% lower than yields of top global producers.</p>
<p>Seeing this as an opportunity where we could help educate farmers and increase crop production, the Krishi Jyoti, or “enlightened agriculture,” Project was created.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="lead orange red">Krishi Jyoti began 10 years ago through a partnership led by Mosaic,</span> the Sehgal Foundation and The Mosaic Company Foundation. Since then, we’ve made massive strides in helping to close the agricultural yield gap in India. Our hands-on collaboration with local farmers and leaders leverages Mosaic’s agronomic and business expertise and the Sehgal Foundation’s proven approach to sustainable community development. The impacts of providing agricultural education have benefitted more than 60,000 people on more than 19,000 acres. These farmers have even seen increases in their income by up to $360 per hectare and in yields by as much as 45%.</p>
<p>But the goal of this project is not only to increase crop yields. It’s also to ingrain best practices within communities so that long-term progress is sustained and additional farmers can go through the program. As of 2018, 75 villages are participating in Krishi Jyoti Projects per year. And our efforts don’t stop there. We go well beyond improving agriculture with this project by improving conditions of educational facilities within the villages. In fact, more than 5,000 children have benefitted from renovations at local schools.</p>
<p>This collaboration has been celebrated through awards on <a href="http://www.mosaicco.com/Who_We_Are/4261.htm">outstanding research, innovation and outreach in the area of crop nutrition and community needs</a>, and it truly is an example of Mosaic living its mission to help the world grow the food it needs.</p>
<p>Krishi Jyoti also promotes water conservation through harvesting rainwater and encouraging water-efficient irrigation technologies. More than 24,000 farmers have benefited from 10 check dams with more than 22 million gallons of water storage capacity.

	<h2>Our Interview with Kyle</h2>

	<div>
					<div class="fc--qa__question_block">
				<h3><span class="fc--qa__start">Q. </span>In 2018, Mosaic shipped a record amount of MicroEssentials<sup><sup>&reg;</sup></sup>—3 million metric tonnes. What makes Premium Products like MicroEssentials so important to agriculture?</h3>
				<span class="fc--qa__start">A. </span><p>From an agriculture industry standpoint, fertilizer technology had been stagnant and commoditized for decades, and then along came MicroEssentials. Mosaic took a traditional commodity product, and added value by combining secondary and micronutrients in one granule. Our proprietary process of producing MicroEssentials provides uniform nutrient distribution across the field and increases nutrient uptake within the plant, which results in higher yields. MicroEssentials was the innovation agriculture needed. As a result, farmers and growers saw—and continue to see—this technology as the path to raise their standards when it comes to crop nutrition.</p>

			</div>
					<div class="fc--qa__question_block">
				<h3><span class="fc--qa__start">Q. </span>How does Mosaic test Premium Products, and why do they invest so much in the research?</h3>
				<span class="fc--qa__start">A. </span><p>Every year, we have nearly 2,000 trial plots around the globe that test products like MicroEssentials, Aspire<sup><sup>&reg;</sup></sup> and K-Mag<sup><sup>&reg;</sup></sup> with multiple crops in multiple geographies. Not very many companies study their products to the extent Mosaic does. We have invested so much in research that farmers and retailers have confidence in MicroEssentials and other products we’ve brought to market. Putting our work to the test as diligently as we have allows us to continue having a trusted leadership role in the industry.</p>

			</div>
					<div class="fc--qa__question_block">
				<h3><span class="fc--qa__start">Q. </span>What can you tell us about new products coming up?</h3>
				<span class="fc--qa__start">A. </span><p>Mosaic continues to look for the next MicroEssentials—the next thing in crop nutrition. I’m excited that we’ve created a team with the purpose of looking for opportunities and solutions—we are not just looking at potash and phosphate, but also new capabilities that will deliver value and add the next dimension of growing food for a growing world. In the end, one of the most important ways we measure success is yield. Are we helping growers provide more and higher-quality food in a sustainable way? That is one of the most rewarding parts of my job here at Mosaic.</p>
